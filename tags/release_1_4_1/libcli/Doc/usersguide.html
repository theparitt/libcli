<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
libcli provides a consistant command-line environment for remote clients,
with a few common features between every implemtation.
</P>

<P>
The library is not accessed by itself, rather the software which uses
it listens on a defined port for a Telnet connection. This connection
is handed off to libcli for processing.
</P>

<P>
The first thing that libcli does is the Telnet negotiation necessary to
establish a character mode session, rather than the Telnet default of
a line mode session. This is to enable command-line editing, completion
and history.
</P>

<P>
A libcli implementation may require authentication before giving you
access to the environment. If so, a <EM>Username:</EM> prompt will be
issued. Enter the username you have been given, and a <EM>Password:</EM>
prompt will appear. The characters you enter for your password will not
be echoed.
</P>

<P>
To leave any libcli command-line environment, enter the command
"<EM>quit</EM>" (aliases are <EM>exit</EM> and <EM>logout</EM>), hit
Ctrl-D, or simply break the connection.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="history">History</A></H2>

<P>
libcli keeps track of the last 256 commands you entered in the session. To
search back through the history, use the up and down arrow keys. The Up
arrow selects the previous command.
<P>

<P>
You can also enter "<EM>history</EM>" to get a list of all the commands
in the history.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="editing">Command-Line Editing</A></H2>

<P>
You can edit the command currently at the prompt:
<LI>Left &amp; Right arrows move the cursor around on the line.</LI>
<LI>Ctrl-U clears the line</LI>

<P>
After changing the line and hitting enter, the new command line will be
added to the end of the history.
</P>

<P>
If you don't remember the command name that you want, you can press
? at any time to get a list of available commands. If you enter ? when
you are half-way through entering a word, you will get a list of all
commands which match what you have already entered.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="filters">Filters</A></H2>

<P>
You can limit the output of any command to a subset of the total output
by using any of the built-in filters. Developers may also add additional
filters when libcli is embedded in some other software.
</P>

<P>
You specify that you want to use a filter by appending <B>|</B> (pipe)
to your command line, followed by the filter name, and any parameters
that the filter requires. The built-in filters available are:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>inc</B> - Only include lines which match the any of the
	supplied parameters.</LI>

	<LI><B>begin</B> - Display everything that comes after the first
	line that matches the single supplied parameter.</LI>

	<LI><B>between</B> - You must specify 2 parameters, and only
	the output that occurs following the first paramater, and before
	the second parameter will be displayed.</LI>
</UL>
